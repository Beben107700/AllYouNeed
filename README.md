All You Need
=============

We are the 2013 Duke TiP students at the University of Georgia taking the
Team Programming for Video Games class during the first term of the program.
Most of the students in the class began programming for the first time at
the beginning of the term in June, and the program lasted three weeks.
This specific Bukkit project is a group effort of some of the people from
this class.

This project was to help us learn how to code for Java after learning C#
and apply the knowledge we learned to our favorite gameâ€¦ Minecraft! So,
here is the result of our first Bukkit project.

This plugin is sponsored by CrystalCraftMC, a semi-vanilla Minecraft server.

December 2013 Update
====================

After long-distance took its toll on our development process, I was left to
handle the plugin alone, and I, jflory7, haven't had much time to work on the
project as nearly as much as I'd like to. A past contributor, Beben107700,
offered to take over the plugin full-time, and he is now the sole maintainer
of the code and future releases.
