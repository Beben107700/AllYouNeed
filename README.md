All You Need
=============

We are the 2013 Duke TiP students at the University of Georgia taking the
Team Programming for Video Games class during the first term of the program.
Most of the students in the class began programming for the first time at
the beginning of the term in June, and the program lasted three weeks.
This specific Bukkit project is a group effort of some of the people from
this class, including dobby1498, NightFog125, Blastprocessor, and jflory7.

This project was to help us learn how to code for Java after learning C#
and apply the knowledge we learned to our favorite gameâ€¦ Minecraft! So,
here is the result of our first Bukkit project.

From the community, we had Beben107700 step and volunteer to assist us with
the coding, so he also works with our team on coding and adding to the plugin!

This plugin is sponsored by CrystalCraftMC, a semi-vanilla Minecraft server.
